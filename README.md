<b><i>IMPORTANT: The main project, as of now, is marked as complete. However, you can still make pull requests, and I will review them. Also, this bot is buggy, so please do bring bugs to my notice. Furthermore, some of these might be caused by Heroku's free hosting service(which I am using for this), and hence these are not in my control.</i></b>
<br>
<br>
A discord bot with many commands, such as getting memes, or being productive using a ToDo list. I made this with Nightcry1, MrNNP and Weeyan.
<br>
We worked on this using Glitch, and the bot is only active on request(will be deployed in a short period), so if you want to see it in action, do contact me.
<br>
If you want to add the bot to your server, you can copy-paste the link provided in linkfordiscord.txt. It has tons of fun commands, so you'll never get bored!
<br>
<br>
Find various commands in reference/commands.txt.
